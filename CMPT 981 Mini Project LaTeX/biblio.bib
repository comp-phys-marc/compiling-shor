	abstract = {We try to minimize the number of qubits needed to factor an integer of n bits using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer. We introduce a circuit which uses 2n+3 qubits and O(n{\textasciicircum}3 lg(n)) elementary quantum gates in a depth of O(n{\textasciicircum}3) to implement the factorization algorithm. The circuit is computable in polynomial time on a classical computer and is completely general as it does not rely on any property of the number to be factored.

	abstract = {In this paper we consider circuit synthesis for n-wire linear reversible circuits using the C-NOT gate library. These circuits are an important class of reversible circuits with applications to quantum computation. Previous algorithms, based on Gaussian elimination and LU-decomposition, yield circuits with O(n{\textasciicircum}2) gates in the worst-case. However, an information theoretic bound suggests that it may be possible to reduce this to as few as O(n{\textasciicircum}2/log n) gates. We present an algorithm that is optimal up to a multiplicative constant, as well as Theta(log n) times faster than previous methods. While our results are primarily asymptotic, simulation results show that even for relatively small n our algorithm is faster and yields more efficient circuits than the standard method. Generically our algorithm can be interpreted as a matrix decomposition algorithm, yielding an asymptotically efficient decomposition of a binary matrix into a product of elementary matrices.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1412.5608},
	abstract = {We present an algorithm for the approximate decomposition of diagonal operators, focusing specifically on decompositions over the Clifford+\$T\$ basis, that minimize the number of phase-rotation gates in the synthesized approximation circuit. The equivalent \$T\$-count of the synthesized circuit is bounded by \$k {\textbackslash}, C\_0 {\textbackslash}log\_2(1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon) + E(n,k)\$, where \$k\$ is the number of distinct phases in the diagonal \$n\$-qubit unitary, \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ is the desired precision, \$C\_0\$ is a quality factor of the implementation method (\$1{\textless}C\_0{\textless}4\$), and \$E(n,k)\$ is the total entanglement cost (in \$T\$ gates). We determine an optimal decision boundary in \$(k,n,{\textbackslash}varepsilon)\$-space where our decomposition algorithm achieves lower entanglement cost than previous state-of-the-art techniques. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for a practical range of \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ values and diagonal operators and can reduce the number of \$T\$ gates exponentially in \$n\$ when \$k {\textless}{\textless} 2{\textasciicircum}n\$.},
